# planb
PlanB is a HTTP and websocket proxy backed by Redis and inspired by Hipache.  It aims to be fully compatible with Hipache when Redis is used as a backend. The same format is used for all keys stored in Redis so migrating from Hipache to PlanB should be completely seamless. The process should be as simple as replacing Hipache's executable for PlanB.
